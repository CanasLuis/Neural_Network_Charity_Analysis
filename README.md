# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Purpose
We received a data ves with information from a lot of organizations that received funding over the recent years. The challenge is to create a machine learning tool that helps us understand wich organizations make good use of the received funds.

## Compile, Train and Evaluate the Model
With the information we have, we can export the CSV data base and clean it, after that we have to use the right tools to train our model and, of course, evaluate it to see if its given results we can trust.
At the very beggining of the code, the model is telling us that columns "EIN" and "NAME" can be droped since this information is not relevant for our purposes. The important thing is to know if the money is being used effectively.

## Optimize the model 
A very important step is to make a model in which we can trust, in order to accomplish that we have to ensure that we are using the right variables, right number of neurons for each hidden layer and also the needed hidden layers. The challenge is to increase the accurancy to at least 75%, or make a pair of additional runs in order to increas the performance

## Summary
We can use the power of machine learning to get a lot of useful information that might help us with the decision making in the real world, however it is important to keep in mind that the tool can be optimized and it not always would give us the results we are expecting. Hopefully we have a lot of options that we can use if the model we implemented is not what we need.
